# nvimConfigFiles

This just shows my nvim/init.vim file and all the neovim plugins I like to use.

Major shouts out to https://vimawesome.com/ for providing a list of useful plugins.

# Note

You should probably use a plugin manager before trying to use plugins. 

Here's the manager I'm using: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.
